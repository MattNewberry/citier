Maintenance
===========

Layout files for the HTML are in **_layout**


Markdown files *.md are converted using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) on push. e.g index.md => index.html

Images located in **images**

the .md files are edited in simple markdown format, see [here](http://support.mashery.com/docs/customizing_your_portal/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet) for a cheat sheet

Easy to maintain, and looks very clean and readable. Hasn't yet been reformatted textually/content-wise, just visually.
